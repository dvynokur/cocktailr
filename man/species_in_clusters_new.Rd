\title{Species in Cocktail clusters (with optional unions)}
\usage{
species_in_clusters_new(x, labels)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A Cocktail object (a list containing \code{Cluster.species}).}

\item{labels}{Selection of clusters. Can be:
\itemize{
\item Character labels like \code{"c_2127"} or integer node IDs
(e.g. \code{2127}), in which case each label defines one group; or
\item A \strong{list} of such vectors, e.g.
\code{list(10, c(11,13), c(12,15), 14)}, where each element
defines a union group of nodes.
}
When \code{x} is a Cocktail object, \code{labels} must be supplied.}
}
\value{
A named list of character vectors. Each element corresponds to one
requested node or union group and contains the species names that belong
to that group (topological union across the selected nodes).
}
\description{
Return the topological species sets for selected Cocktail nodes.
Works only with a Cocktail object and uses its \code{Cluster.species}
component (binary membership).

The \code{labels} argument can be either:
\itemize{
\item a vector of node IDs / labels, where each element is treated as a
separate node; or
\item a \strong{list}, where each element is a vector of node IDs / labels,
and each list element is treated as a \strong{union group} of those
nodes (species are the union across the nodes in that group).
