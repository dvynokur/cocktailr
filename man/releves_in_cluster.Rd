\title{Relevés (plots) passing the m-threshold of Cocktail clusters}
\usage{
releves_in_cluster(x, vegmatrix, clusters)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A Cocktail object (result of \code{cocktail_cluster()}), containing
at least \code{Cluster.species}, \code{Cluster.info}, and \code{plots}.}

\item{vegmatrix}{Matrix or data frame with plots in rows and species in columns.
Values \eqn{>} 0 are treated as presences; \code{NA} or \eqn{\le} 0 as absences.}

\item{clusters}{Character or integer vector giving the cluster IDs to inspect.
Accepts forms like \code{5}, \code{"5"}, or \code{"c_5"}. One or many may be supplied.}
}
\value{
A named list whose names are the \strong{numeric node IDs}.
Each element is a character vector of plot names that meet or exceed
the stored \code{m} threshold (i.e., contain at least \code{m} member species
of that cluster). If no plots qualify, the element is \code{character(0)}.
}
\description{
For each requested cluster (node), return the plots that contain at least
the node-specific threshold \code{m} species from that cluster’s diagnostic set.
The \code{m} threshold is taken directly from the Cocktail object
(\code{x$Cluster.info[, 2]}), as determined by the clustering algorithm.
